======
## Year 1

#### Drown the Scurvy Dog (CS124 Indivudual Project)
A Handhan Simulator in Java using swing. Guess what the pirate says and ye shaln't hav' ta walk the plank ta Davi Jones Locker. Brief is included.

#### Students And Modules
A beginners guide to serializing and deserializing XML and the idea of a "Java Bean". JSON is nicer though...

#### SwingPaint
An introduction to swing, using it as a basic painting utility. dragging and dropping things is relatively easy. Used to experement with packages and event handlers (I miss you C#)

#### Keyboards and Mice
A writeup on the evolution and possible futures on computer interation and peripherals. 

#### Spread and Die
A "Simple" turn-based game in java where the player has to outrun a spreading disease. 

=====
## Year 2

#### C and Unix
A program to calculate positions of sightings of dolphins and porpoise in the Irish sea (and some times Birmingham...). Done in ANSI C98 (or the option of K&R C) on the Gentoo Platform

#### Hardware and Archetecture
Design for a three bit greater than comparitor using [logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/)

#### Systems and Network Administration
A report on upgrading IT  infrastructure and project management of the "University of Costal West Wales" (aka Aberystwyth)

#### Modelling Persistant Data
A task to normalise and implement a database from a sports-and-teams senario, using the Postgresql language

#### Line Following
A simple line following competition in which we were given two hours with part of the track and no time to prepare for the teal thing!

#### Pioneer Robot
A compariason between simulated and real robotics

#### Ladybirds and Aphids
A C++ program to simulate the interactions between Aphids and Ladybirds in an OOP design.

#### Dijkstras Algorithm
An implementation of dijkstras shortest path algorithm using a predetermined interface (ISnapper). Note: the code not in the package `cs21120.assignment2.solution` is a decompilation of the assignment handout jar `CS22120-A2.jar` as it did not include command line run points, so i added these in manually for ease of running in a debugger.
