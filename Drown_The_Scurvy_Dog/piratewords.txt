Freeman: 'Tis true of the— [hears a noise from behind him] What be that noise? Arr, these caves be haunted, says I. But livin' and dead alike shall bow before the great Cap'n Freeman.
Freeman: [Shoots a marine with a shotgun] Arr, the bloodlettin' be flowin' over. I shows no quarter to lubbers such as thee. Ye calls yerselves marines but mariners I says yer not. I bet none of ye could rig a bunt-gasket 'round a mast and jigger if yer lives were hangin' in the balance!
Freeman: Now what'a we have here? An anti-scurvy machine. [headcrabs fall from the ceiling tiles] Shiver me timbers! [shoots them] By the powers! There be all manner o' queer beasties in this hold! I cares not for 'em.

Guard: Okay, why not?

Guard: Didn't want to die alone anyway.
