class BroadcastService

  # The content in the broadcast object will be broadcast to each feed in
  # the feeds hash. Any communication failures will be flagged with an
  # error message in the value of the corresponding feed in the feeds hash
  # and false will be returned, otherwise true is returned
  # Really this should be more OO and the case statement replaced by
  # polymorphic calls. This is left to the reader as an exercise, but ideally
  # you would want to make this a singleton rather than use class scope methods. The
  # error handling mechanism is also a bit clunky and non-user friendly.
